# Performance Bounceback by Kristin Dragos #

## About ## 

This project was created for Udacity's VR Developer Nanodegree with a focus on high immersion VR (Oculus/Vive). This project started out with several issues that caused performance to be incredibly slow (~40 fps). The goal was to optimize the project to improve performance to meet and exceed the standard 90fps. 

## Challenges and Reflection 

I had to add additional lighting in the scene because the light probes and lights that came with the starter project didn't seem to light the entire scene. I really enjoyed getting to work with the profiler and it was pretty amazing how quickly the optimizations  improved performance.
